Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm, yeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (when you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (mm)
Who knows what miracles you can achieve? (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
They don't always happen when you ask
And can it easy to give in to your fears?
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says, "Help is very near, " oh (oh)
There can be miracles (miracles)
When you believe (boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill (hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (you can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now, you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you (when you)
Believe
You will when you (you will when you)
Believe
Just believe (believe)
Darling, just believe
You will when you
Believe
